# doc-lint.sh — documentation anti-drift guard for the qbm-redis module.
#
# Fails on: retired tokens in docs, broken internal Markdown links, cross-repo URLs naming
# a dead repo or a non-released ref, missing module governance files. Warns on: pages missing a "Verified-against" marker.
# Module-wide policy (versioning, support) lives in the qb framework; this guard
# checks qbm-redis's own Markdown (README.md, readme/**, CHANGELOG/SECURITY/CONTRIBUTING)
# plus, through section 1c, the agent-facing llm/ docs that moved into this repo from
# the qb-dev superproject. Those get scripts/llm-guard.py rather than doc_files(): they
# need symbol-existence and content-digest rules this script does not have, and they
# NAME retired tokens in order to warn agents off them, which section 1's cue-less scan
# would report as usage.
#
# Usage:  ./scripts/doc-lint.sh   (from the qbm-redis root)

# Expected qb version for the "Verified-against" markers.
#
# WHERE THIS COMES FROM, and why it is not qb's file directly: this repo is independent and
# its own CI checks out ONLY this repo -- there is no qb tree to read. So the expected value
# has to be derivable from this repo alone, and the one authoritative version here is
# project(qbm-redis VERSION ...) in CMakeLists.txt. That is a legitimate source rather than a
# convenient one: the module is not standalone-configurable (it calls qb_register_module /
# qb_add_test, which an installed qb does not ship), so its version only ever means "the qb
# this module was built against", and the modules are versioned in lockstep with the framework
# by policy.
#
# When a qb checkout IS reachable -- the qb-dev superproject layout, or an explicit QB_ROOT --
# the two are cross-checked below, so lockstep drift fails in the one place it can actually be
# observed. Being unable to determine the version is a HARD STOP, never a skip: a lint that
# quietly passes when it cannot find its expected value is indistinguishable from the
# unvalidated marker it replaces, which is the exact state this closes (129 markers sat at
# "qb 2.6.0" across two version bumps, because only their EXISTENCE was ever checked).
